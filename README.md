I have completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Daffodil International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

With over 6.2 years of experience in testing web and mobile applications‚Äîparticularly in ERP systems, travel agencies, software development, e-commerce platforms, microfinance, and banking solutions‚ÄîI am confident in my ability to make a meaningful contribution to any organization. I am determined to develop myself as a skilled SQA expert.


Some key highlights of my skills and qualifications include:

- Team leadership experience
- Knowledgeable in Git and GitHub
- Thorough understanding of SDLC, STLC, and the bug life cycle
- Hands-on experience with tools like JIRA, JMeter, and Postman

Currently, I am working at Akijbashir Group as a Software Engineer (QA), where I am responsible for ensuring the quality and performance of software systems through both manual and automated testing. In addition to my QA responsibilities, I have also conducted onboarding training sessions for new employees. These sessions provide a comprehensive introduction to the ERP system, tailored to each department‚Äôs specific workflows and the employees‚Äô daily tasks, ensuring efficient adaptation and productive usage of the system.

In my previous experience, I conducted training for a microfinance project owned by Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF). As a software support engineer of M360ICT, I presented all developed software solutions‚Äîincluding the ERP system‚Äîto end-users. This involved preparing user manuals, addressing functional queries, and helping users transition smoothly into the digital workflow environment. This experience significantly strengthened my communication, instructional, and troubleshooting abilities.
